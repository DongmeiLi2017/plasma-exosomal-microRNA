Abnormal expression profile of plasma exosomal microRNAs in exclusive electronic cigarette adult users

Exposure to electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) aerosol has been linked to a number of health concerns, including DNA damage, elevated oxidative stress, release of inflammatory cytokine, and dysfunctions in epithelial barriers. However, little is known about the effect of exclusive e-cigarette use on expression profiles of exosomal miRNAs, which play critical regulatory roles in many inflammatory responses and disease process including cancer. We aim to compare the exosomal microRNAs expression profile between exclusive e-cigarette users and normal controls without any tobacco product use (non-users). Using blood and urine samples from exclusive e-cigarette users and non-users in the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Wave 1 study (2013-2014), we examined exosomal microRNAs expression levels through Illumina NextSeq 500/550 sequencing. We identified microRNAs that have significantly higher expression levels in exclusive e-cigarette users than non-users. Gene enrichment analysis of these significant exosomal microRNAs showed their involvement in cancer related pathways, which might indicate a potential elevated risk of cancer among exclusive e-cigarette users.
